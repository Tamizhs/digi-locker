Internet security involves the protection of a computer's internet account and files from intrusion by an outside user. Internet users today are familiar with companies like Symantec (Norton Anti-Virus) and McAfee that provide them with internet security products to guard against computer viruses, as well as to provide secure firewalls and protection against spyware. Organizations like the Center for Internet Security (CIS) provide enterprises with resources for measuring information security status and making rational security investment decisions.

An example of secure smart card technology usage is the Microsoft .NET card framework. This is a software framework that is available with several Microsoft Windows operating systems. It includes a library of coded solutions to prevent common programming problems and a virtual machine that manages the execution of programs written specifically for the framework.
